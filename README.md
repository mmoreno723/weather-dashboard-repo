# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This application is designed to provide a user with accurate weather information for any given location in the world. Once a city is inputed into the search bar, the city's current temperature, feels like temperature, wind, humidity, and uv index will be displayed. The city's five day forecast (which also shows the aforementioned values) will also be displayed. Upon viewing the UV Index, the user can determine if the level is safe, moderate, or extreme by looking at the background color of the UV index text. This application was created using JavaScript, jQuery, and third-party APIs.
